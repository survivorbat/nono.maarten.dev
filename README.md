# Nonogram

I really like playing nonogram on my phone and wanted to replicate it.

## Prerequisites

In order to run this, you need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm installed.

## Getting Started

The following steps allow you to setup the environment to run this application.

1. Git clone the repository

## TODO

- Make puzzle generation better to always have solvable puzzles
- Don't make the difficulty rank up so fast
